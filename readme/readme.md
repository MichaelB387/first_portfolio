# Portfolio Project

## Design Process

For my portfolio website I wanted to design a site that would be easy for the user to navigate where they wanted to visit, so I decided from the outset that I wanted the design to have a minmalist look and feel whilst also being easily readable and functional.

Sample from my pinterest for design ideas

I was going to base my design from the image below as it was minimal and thought that I could build menu items around the image.

Which led to this design as my original

I wan't too happy with this design or the logo, I didn't like the personal logo being my initials, and all the whitespace that was available.

Here is a sample of the wireframing completed during the design

First I ended up manipulating the columns and turned them into my personal logo, and sourced an image which I liked for the clean lines and repeative nature which I could then incorporate in the background across the other pages.

Then came my final design https://cook-shovel-60166.netlify.com/

# Challenges

There were numerous challenges with this project.

## HTML Challenges
- linking files HTML to CSS
  
  There were numerous times where the html file wouldn't link to the relevent css file, on occasion the site would work when operating on a local server but when uploaded to netlify without any changes the site wouldn't work.
  Also when opening the HTML file directly in a browser window this would run but then the local server version wouldn't work.
  
- adding images

  Managing to get images to load correctly was at times also challenging.

## CSS challenges

- Flexbox

  Using and understanding flexbox at first was quite challenging, just when you would think you had everything correct it would all seem to go wrong. A lot of the time these issues were fixed by going back and forth coding attempt and code again. Making use of online tutorials was a great help.

- Images

  Sizing and importing the images again proved challenging, which was resolved through a lot of trial and error.

- Responsiveness

  Making the website respond correctly to a range of sizes was quite difficult as I had to make use of flexbox again across the different screen sizes.

# Conclusion

The webite is at this stage a finished product but will be an ongoing project to continuosly update and improve the website. I would like to add more features such as animation and also make the mobile version more appealing.
